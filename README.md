# redactor-list-styles

This redactor plugin adds a new menu item to the `lists` dropdown which provides modal interface to choose from a configurable drop down of class names that you can use to style the list differently.

This is an early draft of the plugin and any bug reports would be appreciated.

## Installation

If you're using Craft CMS, copy the file `src/listclass.js` from this repository into your `cms/config/redactor/plugins` directory.

## Caveats

* This plugin piggy backs on the same Redactor selection code that lets you toggle a list  between ordered/unordered, and as such it similarly ignores any nested / indented lists and only applies the class name to the highest level parent list that currently selected.

* Class names are lost when toggling list type between `<ol>` and `<ul>`. I may be able to change that in the future, but it doesn't look like it's going to be easy, and I'm not sure how big a need there is for that functionality.

* It's not currently possible to configure two sets of available classes, one for `<ul>` and another set for `<ol>`. Very possible for the future, but not yet implemented.


## Configuration

You can configure the available list styles within your redactor JSON config file:

*Sample Redactor-Config.json*

```
  ...
  "plugins": ["listclass"],
  "listClasses" : [
    { "label": "Two Column",        "class": "two-column" },
    { "label": "Checkmark Bullets", "class": "checkmarks" }
  ]
  ...
```

## Styling lists inside Redactor

If you want your list class names to appear differently within the redactor editor, you'll need to inject some css into your admin panel.

*Sample control-panel.css*

```
    .input .redactor-styles ul.two-column {
        column-count: 2;
    }

    .input .redactor-styles ul.checkmarks li::marker {
        color: green;
        content: 'âœ“  ';
        font-weight: bold;
    }
```

If you're using Craft CMS you could either use a plugin to inject this code into your admin panel, or you can create a module and load your own CSS file.

If you're using Redactor in some other tool, you'll have to do your own digging to figure out how to add CSS in your editor.
